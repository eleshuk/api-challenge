> Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
>> * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
>> * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
>> * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
>> * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.

Run a linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  

>> * Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
>> * Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
>> * Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
>> * Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
>> * Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
>> * Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
>> * Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
>> * Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
